# This is the lecturer's validation file from the course repo, kept
# unmodified as evidence for the report. Everything below this block is his.

# WARNING: line 7 is `drop table if exists personal_movies_ranking`.
# Running this file destroys the 7,045 loaded rankings.
#
# Our runnable version, which checks the same things without dropping
# anything, is personal_ranking_validation.sql in this folder.
#
# Why this file matters: the header comment below documents the staging
# approach - create the table without protection, load, identify violations,
# then recreate with the original protection. That is exactly what pipeline
# steps 04 and 06 implement.
# ============================================================

# personal_movies_ranking has defences that protect you from inserting improper data.
# In case that you have already created improper data (that should not happen),
# you can create the table without protection, insert your data, and identify the violaitons.
# After fixing your data, run this script again on the fixed data.
# Then, recreate personal_movies_rankingwith the original protection and verify that your code is correct.
